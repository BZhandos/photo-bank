        Innovative and creative web developer with in excess of 3 years extensive experience in frontline development and testing of web-based applications. My strong background includes front-end development using HTML5, CSS3, SAAS/SCSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap â€“ in addition to knowledge of version control systems such as SVN and Git, and a thorough understanding of object-oriented programming and design patterns. In my previous roles, I have worked closely with internal Product & Marketing Teams, and external agencies when required, to deliver innovative features across all digital touchpoints, and produce concepts into fully-functional user-validated product, through the use of our CMS (HubSpot, in the most recent example).
